# JBossTools VersionWatch #

## Description ##
VersionWatch (vwatch) is application for comparing bundles across several eclipse installations based on several predefined criteria. If criterium is not fulfilled an issue is raised. When evaluation is completed, reports are generated.

  * **BundleVersionReport** (report_detailed.html)
  * **ProductReport** (report_summary.html)

## Critera ##
  
  * **FolderAndJarIssue** - there are unexpected both foder and jar file for some bundle
  * **MD5Issue** - same bundle doesnâ€™t have the same MD5 between installation (deep file scan is performed if needed), disabled by default
  * **MultipleVersionIssue** - bundle is present in multiple versions (ignored cases can be defined in multiple-version-ignore.properties)
  * **OkIssue** - reports that previous issue was fixed
  * **VersionDecreasedIssue** - bundle version is lower than bundle version in previous installation
  

## Prerequisites ##
Version watch requires one folder containing several Eclipse installation, for example:

* /opt/vw/
    * eclipse-4.2.0-final
    * eclispe-4.2.1-m1
    * eclipse-4.2.2-m2

## Execution ##
  
### Executing as JUnit test via maven ###
  
    mvn -fae clean test [-Dparameter[=value]...]
        
For example:

    mvn clean test -Dvwatch.installationsDir="/tmp/vw"
      
### Executing as JAR application ###

#### Install JBDS

First, perform 2 or more JBDS installs using `install.devstudio.sh` (or install by hand).

You can also do a headless install using a script like this to invoke a console install into ${HOME}/jbdevstudio:

    # move any existing install in ${HOME}/jbdevstudio first
    if [[ -d ${HOME}/jbdevstudio ]]; then mv ${HOME}/jbdevstudio{,.PREVIOUS}; echo "Old JBDS install in ${HOME}/jbdevstudio moved to ${HOME}/jbdevstudio.PREVIOUS"; fi

    # pipe "1" to the console install to accept the license terms and install into ${HOME}/jbdevstudio
    echo 1 | java -jar jboss-devstudio-*installer*.jar -console; echo "Installed to ${HOME}/jbdevstudio"

NOTE: If you did a headless or by-hand install, move those installs into whatever folder you set with `-Dvwatch.installationsDir` below. 

NOTE: If you used `install.devstudio.sh` then the `-INSTALL_FOLDER` parameter should be used to set the folder into which you're installing. That folder should be the same as the one you specify with `-Dvwatch.installationsDir` below.

#### Run versionwatch

Next, use versionwatch to compare those installs:

    # fetch sources and build it
    git clone https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-vwatch.git
    cd vwatch; mvn clean package -DskipTests=true

    # run it and capture a log
    java -jar "-Dvwatch.installationsDir=/tmp/vw" "-Dvwatch.md5check" target/vwatch-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar | tee log.txt


## Parameters ##
**vwatch.loglevel** - specify log4j loglevel for vw logs  
values: 7 -debug, 6- info, 4- warn, 3 - error, 0 - fatal  
default: all
example: -Dvwatch.loglevel=6

**vwatch.installationsDir** - directory where eclipse installations are located  
default: /opt/vw
example: -Dvwatch.installationsDir=/opt/my_ide_container_dir

**vwatch.product** - product for which the specific product report is generated
default: last product (product with the highest version)
example:

**vwatch.filter** - report will contain only items matching filter  
defaut: all items will be visible  
example: -Dvwatch.filter=org.jboss.tools.*

**vwatch.md5check** - enableds MD5 check comparing related bundles accross installations  
defaut: disabled  
example: -Dvwatch.md5check

**vwatch.includeVersions** - allows to list only selected installations  
defaut: \d+\.\d+\.\d+  

**vwatch.excludeVersions** - allows to exclude selected installations  
default: none  

**vwatch.includeIUs** - allows to include specific bundles  
default: ".*"

**vwatch.excludeIUs** - allows to exclude specific bundles  
default: none;

**vwatch.setLogLevel** - allows to set log level  
default: Level.WARN (4)
