# JBossTools VersionWatch #

## Description ##
VersionWatch (vwatch) is application for comparing bundles across several eclipse installations based on several predefined criteria. If criterium is not fulfilled an issue is raised. When evaluation is completed, reports are generated.

  * **BundleVersionReport** (report_detailed.html)
  * **ProductReport** (report_summary.html)

## Critera ##
  
  * **FolderAndJarIssue** - there are unexpected both foder and jar file for some bundle
  * **MD5Issue** - same bundle doesnâ€™t have the same MD5 between installation (deep file scan is performed if needed), disabled by default
  * **MultipleVersionIssue** - bundle is present in multiple versions (ignored cases can be defined in multiple-version-ignore.properties)
  * **OkIssue** - reports that previous issue was fixed
  * **VersionDecreasedIssue** - bundle version is lower than bundle version in previous installation
